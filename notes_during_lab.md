# Notes from During the Lab
## 1pm: Meeting in BA2155 for strategy
* Created spreadsheet and document
* Selected report template
* Reviewed airfoil concepts

## Prelab
1. Stall is actually a SUBSTANTIAL separation resulting in an even cp distribution afterward
2. Expect to see moment change (usually evenly negative, becomes zero or positive), different pressure distr (uniform plateau)
3. Can use PIV or whatever as well

** visc drag can also be measured with shear sensors

## Sources of Error
* Assume precision error to be zero because we only have one point
* Bias error on incline: About 1 mm (half of min gradation) because it's a maximum estimate
    Assume bias error of scanivalve to be almost zero
    Precision error on port 36 from time series; just demonstrate using 1 from each AoA
    Bias Errors in AoA
    Bias Errors in Traverse

## Discussion
* Measurements are not good for post-stall because of amplitude attentuation and frequency lag
