# AER303 Lab 1 Preparation Questions
1. What is your interpretation of airfoil stall?
    
    Stall is when airflow no longer sticks to the profile of the airfoil, causing loss of lift, as well as increased drag.

2. How would you expect the stalled condition to manifest itself when you perform the experiment?
    * High drag force from measurements in the wake
    * Dramatic change in pressure distribution over the airfoil itself

3.  Suggest some other methods that might be used to determine the lift of an airfoil.
    * Load cell on the airfoil mount itself to directly measure lift and drag
