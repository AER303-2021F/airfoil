\begin{abstract}

In this report, the properties of the Clark Y airfoil are empirically explored at varying angles of attack by measuring airfoil surface and wake pressure distributions in a subsonic wind tunnel. The center of pressure distributions, a momentum balance to determine the total drag, and numerical methods to calculate the coefficients of lift, (pressure) drag, and moment are calculated. The measurements for these calculations are collected using two separate methods, and their comparative effectiveness is evaluated.\newline

Through analysis, it was found that the Clark Y airfoil appeared to stall at $\alpha\approx 13^\circ$. This conclusion was supported by the $C_P$ curves which showed a large plateau region for $\alpha\geq13^\circ$ indicating significant flow separation. For the same region, the $C_L$ curve experienced a significant drop in the lift slope and the $C_D$ curve had a sudden increase. No useful information could be extracted from the $C_M$ curve which remained relatively constant regarding the angle of attack.\newline

The empirically attained airfoil characteristics reflected the general trends and magnitudes of the values calculated from XFOIL and reported in the literature. This suggests that the results, within an experimental error, accurately reflect the true behaviour of a Clark Y airfoil in uniform flow at varying angles of attack.

\section{Introduction and Background}\label{sec:introduction_and_background}

\noindent
This report aims to explore the experimental performance of a Clark Y airfoil at varying angles of attack, $\alpha$, to understand the characteristic dependency on the angle of attack. A secondary goal of the report is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of two methods of measuring pressure distributions, and compare these methods to simulations and the literature.\newline

\noindent
Airfoils are two-dimensional, wing cross-sections that produce lift by accelerating flow over their contour which result in a surface pressure distribution that can cause a net lifting action. At the same time, airfoils produce drag forces through skin friction and fluid viscosity. The combination of both the lift and drag forces impart a pitching moment on the airfoil which, in aircraft design, must be balanced by the horizontal stabilizer. Since the lift, drag, and moment forces depend on the airfoil's pressure distribution which varies with the angle of attack, the performance of the airfoil in producing sufficient lift to sustain flight will thusly depend on the angle the airfoil makes with the relative airflow. Gaining insight into the angle of attack evolution of the airfoil's lift, drag, and moment is necessary for learning the stall and performance characteristics of the airfoil which are necessary in aircraft design.\newline

\subsection{Normal, Axial, and Moment Forces}

\noindent
Ignoring viscous effects, the normal and axial forces on an airfoil describe the net effect of a pressure distribution over the airfoil. The normal force is the net pressure force exerted normal to the aircraft's chord. In contrast, the axial force is the net pressure force acting parallel to the aircraft's chord. These forces yield lift and pressure drag forces when combined with the angle of attack as will be discussed in section \ref{sec:LDC}\newline

\noindent
With an airfoil in a uniform flow, let $P_u$ and $P_\ell$ be the pressure distributions over the airfoil's top and bottom surfaces respectively. Additionally, let $\theta$ be the angle between the chord normal and the airfoil surface normal measured clockwise. From these measures, the normal and axial forces acting on the airfoil can be calculated using equations \ref{eq:normal_force} and \ref{eq:axial_force} where the normal and axial components are summed over the airfoil's surface to yield the net normal and net axial component. The normal and axial definitions can be represented pictorially in figure \ref{fig:airfoil_directions} where the expressed forces define their positive orientations. In a similar approach, the moment around the leading edge of the airfoil is given by equation \ref{eq:leading_edge_moment} which integrates the product of the moment arm and force acting in both the normal and axial direction. A positive moment value is defined to be the angular direction that increases the angle of attack.\newline

\begin{align}
    N' &= \int_{LE}^{TE} -P_u\cos\theta ds_u + \int_{LE}^{TE} P_\ell\cos\theta ds_\ell
    \label{eq:normal_force}\\
    A' &= \int_{LE}^{TE} -P_u\sin\theta ds_u + \int_{LE}^{TE} P_\ell\sin\theta ds_\ell
    \label{eq:axial_force}\\
    M' &= \int_{LE}^{TE} \left[(P_u\cos\theta)x - (P_u\sin\theta)y\right]ds_u + \int_{LE}^{TE} \left[(-P_\ell\cos\theta)x + (P_\ell\sin\theta)y\right]ds_\ell
    \label{eq:leading_edge_moment}
\end{align}

\subsection{Calculating Lift, Drag and Dimensionless Coefficients}\label{sec:LDC}

\noindent
The lift of an airfoil is defined as the net force exerted on the airfoil normal to the relative airflow, whereas the drag is the net force parallel to the relative airflow. These forces per unit span can be calculated using equations \ref{eq:lift} and \ref{eq:drag} where the angle of attack, $\alpha$, is the angle between the airfoil's chord line and the relative airflow. The lift and drag definitions can be represented pictorially in figure \ref{fig:airfoil_directions} where the expressed forces define their positive orientations.\newline

\begin{align}
    L' &= N'\cos\alpha - A'\sin\alpha \label{eq:lift} \\
    D' &= N'\sin\alpha + A'\cos\alpha \label{eq:drag}
\end{align}

\end{figure}

\noindent
To express the performance of an airfoil in a manner that is quasi-decoupled from the flow properties, the lift, drag, moment, and pressure distributions are often expressed in nondimensionalized form.

\noindent
The nondimensionalized pressure can be found using using equation \ref{eq:cp} where $q_\infty\equiv\frac{1}{2}\rho_\infty U_\infty^2$ is the free stream dynamic pressure.\newline

\begin{equation}
    C_p = \frac{\Delta P}{q_\infty}
    \label{eq:cp}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Lift, drag, and moment can also be nondimensionalized using equations \ref{eq:cl}, \ref{eq:cd}, and \ref{eq:cm} respectively, where $C$ is the airfoil's chord length.\newline

\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{equation}
    C_L = \frac{L'}{q_\infty C}
    \label{eq:cl}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    C_D = \frac{D'}{q_\infty C}
    \label{eq:cd}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    C_M = \frac{M'}{q_\infty C^2}
    \label{eq:cm}
\end{equation}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Calculating Total Drag from Wake Velocity}

\noindent
The drag force formulation stated earlier (equation \ref{eq:drag}) ignores viscous effects because this experiment cannot directly measure the shear force distribution over the surface of the airfoil. That means the force in equation \ref{eq:drag} only gives pressure drag. The total drag, typically a value of interest is calculated by performing a momentum balance in a control volume containing the airfoil, to determine how much the airfoil has decelerated the flow around it. The equation to calculate the total drag per unit span is given in equation \ref{eq:wake_drag}.\newline

\begin{align}
    D' &= \rho\int_{\text{rake}} u (U_\infty - u) dy \label{eq:wake_drag}
\end{align}

\subsection{Stall}

\noindent
An airfoil stall is characterized by a significant separation of flow from the airfoil surface resulting in several effects that can be observed in the dimensionless curves.

\begin{itemize}

    \item When flow separation occurs, the $C_P$ distribution plateaus in the region of separation as separation will occur in the presence of non-favourable pressure gradients.
    
    \item As $\alpha$ increases, $C_L$ increases linearly until it reaches a peak and then falls sharply. The peak and fall of the $C_L$ curve is a result of the increasingly dominant viscous effects associated with this higher angles of attack.
    
    \item The flow separation associated with an impending stall incurs higher drag, resulting in increasing $C_D$ curve for all angles of attack above the minimum stall angle (critical angle of attack).
    
    \item $C_{M, LE}$ remains a nearly constant negative value until the airfoil stalls, at which point $C_{M, LE}$ becomes increasingly more negative which forces an unconstrained airfoil to pitch down.
    
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Stalled conditions lead to unpredictable behaviour of an airfoil and reduced aircraft controllability as the lack of airflow over control surfaces cause a slow and sloppy control response. It is important to understand the behaviour of varying the angle of attack on the lift, drag, and moment characteristics of an airfoil to understand its limitations.

\section{Experimental Set-Up}

\noindent
This section details the lab setup and procedure used in the experiment.

\subsection{Apparatus}

\noindent
The Clark Y airfoil specimen used in the experiment is a 3D printed model, with 19 holes along the centerline of the span allowing pressure measurements over the surface. The pressure tap locations are presented in table \ref{tab:pressure_taps}.\newline

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline

    \label{tab:pressure_taps}
\end{table}

\noindent
The tests on the airfoil are conducted in an ELD Model 402B subsonic open-return wind tunnel, with a 304.8 x 304.8 x 610 mm  square prismatic test section. The airfoil is shown installed in the wind tunnel in figure \ref{fig:wind_tunnel_setup}. The airfoil is secured using a rotary mechanism to vary the angle of attack across trials and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:aoa_select}.\newline

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Apparatus Pictures/wind_tunnel_setup.jpg}

    \caption{Adjustable rotary mechanism to hold the airfoil at different angles of attack.}
    \label{fig:aoa_select}
\end{figure}

\noindent
In addition to the 19 static pressure taps on the airfoil, there are 17 pitot tubes arranged as a rake, placed $27\si{cm}$ downstream of the airfoil's trailing edge. A pitot-static tube placed upstream of the airfoil is used for wind tunnel speed measurements, with the pitot tube connected to a Betz manometer and the static tube used as the reference pressure in the two measurement devices.\newline

\noindent
A total of 38 pressure tubes exit the wind tunnel; one is the upstream pitot tube connecting to the Betz manometer while the other 37 connect to the measurement devices. The latter 37 tubes are bifurcated to feed into both a multi-channel Scanivalve-transducer system and an inclined manometer.\newline

\noindent
The Scanivalve system is pictured in figure \ref{fig:scanivalve} and is responsible for redirecting a specific pressure tube to an output measuring device. The analog pressure transducer is connected to the sampling and reference outputs of the Scanivalve. The connected Scanivalve rapidly switches between the 36 pressure tubes such that the pressure transducer measures the pressure difference between the sampled pressure and the reference pressure from the upstream static tube. The analog signal from the pressure transducer is fed into a data acquisition card connected to a computer running MATLAB to collect the data.\newline

    \caption{Scanivalve system, connected to a pressure transducer. The system allows for rapid switching between the 36 channels to allow the transducer to sweep through all pressure inputs.}
    \label{fig:scanivalve}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The inclined manometer takes in 36 input channels and one reference channel to measure the pressure difference between each of the 36 inputs compared to the reference pressure which is set to that of the upstream static tube.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{sec:procedure}

% What is measured and how it is acquired.

\noindent
The procedure used for acquisition of pressure measurements is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The sample frequency and data acquisition time are determined such that the pressure transducer measurements admit a $\pm 1\%$ accuracy. Set the wind tunnel speed to $110\si{km.h^{-1}}$. A series of representative measurements from the pressure transducer output are then taken and autocorrelated to determine the sample frequency and data acquisition time required for $\pm 1\%$ accuracy.
    
    \item The calibration curve for the pressure transducer is constructed next. This allows interpolated conversion from voltage-pressure representations of pressure transducer measurements into equivalent pressure values. The curve is constructed by taking ten different voltage-pressure measurements at varying wind tunnel speeds using scanivalve readings while finding the corresponding pressure measurements using the Betz manometer. This correspondence between representations is used to calibrate the pressure-voltage curve of the transducer.
    
    \item The wind tunnel speed is set back to $110\si{km.h^{-1}}$ and wind tunnel's pitot-static pressure difference is measured to calculate the actual wind speed experienced in the wind tunnel.
    
    \item Next, the angle of attack is changed in the positive and negative directions to determine the angle of attack associated with the airfoil stall. Using this information, it is determined what angles of attack would be useful to measure to accurately represent the airfoil properties up to and past stall conditions. The angle of attack values chosen were \numlist{0;3;6;8;10;11;13;15;16;17;20} degrees.

    \item Cycling through each angle of attack, the pressure distribution is measured along the top and bottom surfaces of the airfoil in addition to the pressure distribution in the airfoils wake. These values are measured by reading the fluid height changes from the inclined manometer. To get greater precision in the wake measurements, the wake rake is displaced by $5\si{mm}$ for a second round of measurements to fill the gaps between each rake tube. Pressure measurements are taken using two methods: (1) the pressure transducer fed by the scanivalve device and (2) the inclined manometer.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Following the acquisition of pressure measurements, the data is pre-processed to obtain pressure distributions as well as pressure coefficients over the airfoil and in its wake. This pre-processing follows the following procedure depending on the measurement method.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item For data calculated using the pressure transducer, the calibration curve for the pressure transducer is used to convert raw data into equivalent pressure readings, using an interpolation script.

    \item For the inclined manometer approach, the data is captured in images which were annotated using a web based data extraction tool for converting image embedded data into csv files.\cite{Rohatgi2020} In this annotation stage, the graph boundaries and the scale of the graph were specified. The peaks of each manometer tube were selected on the image. The program then interpolated between the boundaries to get a measure of the selection. Distortions in the image can cause nonlinear length scales that can introduce error into the data acquisition as discussed in section \ref{sec:non_quantifiable_sources_of_error}. From the csv data, the change in static pressure is determined from the change of fluid height for each manometer tube compared to an "at-rest" state and using Bernoulli's relation.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
After the data is pre-processed, the data is analyzed to determine the lift, moment, and drag coefficients as well as a measure of the lift, moment, and pressure drag of the airfoil up to and past the point of stall. The analysis is done using the methods described in section \ref{sec:introduction_and_background}.\newline

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{XFOIL Reference}

\noindent
Results in this section will be compared to data obtained from \textit{XFOIL}, a free airfoil analysis software. The results generated from XFOIL were specified to the Clark Y airfoil using a \verb|.dat| file obtained from \href{http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=clarky-il}{airfoiltools.com}. For the setup, 240 panel nodes were used in the viscous solver mode, with a Reynolds number of $Re = 200000$. Pressure distributions, and the dimensionless coefficients were determined for all $\alpha$ values used in the experiment.\newline

\subsection{Pressure Visualization and Coefficient of Pressure}

\noindent
Pressure distributions were obtained using the pre-processing procedure described in section \ref{sec:procedure}, and further normalized using equation \ref{eq:cp}. The free stream velocity $U_\infty$ is taken to be the mean between the measured velocity at the upper-most (port 20) and bottom-most (port 36) rakes. Figure \ref{fig:cp} illustrates the $C_p$ distributions at each angle of attack. \newline

\end{figure}

\noindent
Overall, the trends of the $C_p$ distribution fit the theoretical prediction. The upper wing has a more negative pressure distribution than the lower wing. The resulting pressure differential provides lift to the airfoil. The $C_p$ changes drastically in the small region directly succeeding the leading edge due to the static pressure. For lower angles of attack, the $C_p$ changes gradually after the leading edge, but for higher angles of attack, due to viscous effects, a pressure plateau becomes. Such plateaus become significant for $\alpha \ge 13^\circ$ which is associated with the stalling of the airfoil. The plateau of the upper airfoil surface $C_p$ distribution reduces the pressure gradient between the top and bottom airfoil surfaces which then result in a loss of lift. Aircraft designers must consider stalling effects, and optimize the stall angles. Pilots also should be reminded about stall angles to prevent accidents during flight (specifically when making abrupt pitching actions).\newline

\noindent
The general pattern of the $C_p$ distribution, as well as the stall angle is verified with XFOIL. Experimental results deviate slightly at the leading edge with XFOIL, which likely originates from the assumptions XFOIL employs (despite having a separate viscous solver). Such errors between representations can alert aerodynamicists where a model differs from real life thereby highlighting where experiments must be conducted in order to see the full picture. Furthermore, the $C_p$ distribution is consistent with the literature\cite{lyon_broeren_giguere_gopalarathnam_selig_1997} which reports the $C_p$ distribution as seen in figure \ref{fig:lit_cp} and agrees with the overall pattern seen in the experiment.

\subsection{Wake Velocity Profile}

\noindent
Wake velocities are obtained from total pressure measurements in the wake to determine the flow velocity distribution over the height of the pressure rake. Resulting total drag is computed numericall using Equation \ref{fig:total_drag_coefficient} and \verb|trapz| in MATLAB. The drag coefficient $C_D$ is obtained using Equation \ref{eq:cd}. Wake velocity and $C_D$ results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:wake_velocities} and \ref{fig:total_drag_coefficient}.\newline

\noindent
The shape of the wake velocity distributions are consistent with theory, indicating that the airfoil only disturbs flow near it, and that the velocity profile going off to infinity approaches the freestream velocity. It should be noted that the wake velocity profiles, especially for $\alpha$ near and around stall, exhibit time-varying effects such as vortex shedding not captured by the static measurements of this experiment. The large jagged fluctuations in the observed data are an artifact of the measurement process. The wake velocity distributions should be collected using a time-averaging method of many measurements over a long period of time if the experiment were to be repeated with more time allotted.\newline

\noindent
In both sets of plots, a dramatic change happens between $\alpha = 13^\circ$ and $\alpha = 15 ^\circ$. The peak velocity deficit increases in magnitude, and shifts downward in position. The downwards movement of the peak is due to the increasing angle of attack deflecting more flow downward, and is not related to stall. The dramatically large peak is indicative of stall, separated flow produces much more drag than well-attached flow.\newline

\noindent
$C_D$ jumps up dramatically between $\alpha = 13^\circ$ and $\alpha = 15 ^\circ$. This is indicative of stall occurring and producing more drag. Based on these measurements, the stall angle appears to be about $13^\circ$.\newline

\noindent
Both sets of measurements agree with XFOIL, both in terms of predicting stall angle, as well as the general shape of the $C_D$ curve. Error bars overlap the simulation data for most of the datapoints, suggesting good measurements and a good estimation of error. The manometer error bars are larger than those of the scanivalve, due to many sources of error in the scanivalve not being accounted for.\newline

\label{tab:mano_coeff}
\end{table}

\noindent
In both plots, the coefficient of lift increases with the angle of attack until $\alpha\approx13^\circ$ at which the coefficient of lift begins decreasing for all higher angles of attack. There are various features within the lift curve to discuss.

\begin{itemize}

    \item The first feature to discuss is the non-zero coefficient of lift produced at $\alpha=0^\circ$. This signifies a degree of camber inherent to the airfoil indicating that the Clark Y airfoil is not symmetric which is in line with our understanding.
    
    \item A linear $C_L$-$\alpha$ dependency exists for angles of attack within the approximate range from $0^\circ$ to $8^\circ$. This region is characterized by a very minimal boundary layer that does not significantly hinder lift production.
    
    \item For the approximate range from $8^\circ$ to $13^\circ$, there is a diminishing lift slope. As the angle of attack increases, the point of separation moves forward on the leading edge as seen by the beginning of the plateau on the $C_p$ plots. The growing boundary layer inhibits lift production thereby reducing the rate of $C_L$ increase.
    
    \item For $\alpha\approx13^\circ$, we have the critical angle of attack (where $C_L$ is a maximum) where the increased flow separation dominates causing diminishing lift. The critical angle of attack is a significant characteristic of an airfoil as it sets a lower bound on the speed at which an aircraft can fly. As an aircraft slows down, a higher angle of attack is necessary to produce sufficient lift to counterbalance the aircraft's weight. Although increasing the angle of attack, as seen in the $C_L$ plots will only be met with increasing lift until this critical angle is met at which the aircraft can no longer sustain flight.
    
    \item For the remainder of the $C_L$ curve, increasing the angle of attack emphasizes the domination of flow separation and the continual decrease in lift production.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The coefficient of drag plots decrease initially but as they begin nearing the critical angle of attack, they begin to increase indicating an increased pressure drag force applied to the airfoil. The increasing nature of the $D_{D,p}$ curve around and past the critical angle is due to the increasing boundary layer thickness which results in higher viscous effects and consequently more drag experienced.\newline

\noindent
Lastly, the coefficient of moment curves follow a behaviour inverse to that of the (pressure) drag coefficient where it increases with an increasing angle of attack until the critical angle is reached before becoming more negative with a further increase in the angle of attack. This behaviour of the moment force on an airfoil is essential from a pilot perspective as it provides safe handling characteristics around the point of a stall. When an aircraft stalls, the goal of the pilot is to increase the airflow over the airfoil to regain laminar flow and reduce the drag effects. This is accomplished by lowering the angle of attack. The $C_M$ behaviour exhibited by the Clark Y airfoil, would cause the airfoil to pitch down when in a stall configuration which would allow for the regain of lift. Thusly, the moment behavior of an airfoil is an important consideration in aircraft design.\newline

\noindent
The coefficients calculated from the experimental data can be compared to the results from XFOIL as seen in figures \ref{fig:scani_comp} and \ref{fig:mano_comp} for the scanivalve and manometer data respectively.\newline

\noindent
The experimental results are a better match for the $C_L$ and $C_D$ curve for the scanivalve data where the majority of the XFOIL data falls within the uncertainty of the experimental data. Since the experimental procedure did not calculate viscous effects, the experimental $C_D$ curve begins to deviate from the XFOIL $C_D$ curve at higher angles of attack when viscous effects become significant. XFOIL's viscous solver makes it a more accurate descriptor of the real flow in high viscous conditions. \newline

\noindent
For the manometer data, there is a larger deviation between the lift and drag coefficient curves compared to the XFOIL data. These discrepancies are emphasized by the greater sources of error associated with manometer measurements described in section \ref{sec:source_of_error}. The relationships between the lift and drag coefficient curves for the manometer data compared to the XFOIL data are similar to that of the scanivalve-to-XFOIL relationships stated earlier.

Experimental performance data of a Clark Y airfoil is available in literature
\cite{lyon_broeren_giguere_gopalarathnam_selig_1997}. The relevant plots on page 81 and 83 give experimental results for dimensionless coefficients measured in a more professional manner. These are shown in Figure \ref{fig:clark_y_reference}.\newline

The shape of the $C_L$ vs $\alpha$ plot in Figure \ref{fig:coeffs} agrees well with the reference experiment in terms of stall angle, as well as the plateau behaviour around 10 degrees.

Pressure drag makes up only a small portion of total drag for all measurements taken, consistent with theory from AER307 on airfoils at low speed. Total drag jumps sharply at stall $\alpha \approx 13^\circ$, indicative of a large viscous wake forming from separated flow. Pressure drag increases with $\alpha$ due to the airfoil itself pitching up. 

The relative errors in the drag calculations are large, particularly for the pressure drag values. Therefore, trends observed in the pressure drag values are unreliable.

\label{tab:quant_error}
\end{table}

The precision error for the Scanivalve reading is acquired via an autocorrelation analysis. The autocorrelation formula is:
\begin{align}\label{eq:autocorrelation}
    T &= \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\overline{(x(t)-\bar{x})\cdot(x(t-\tau)-\bar{x})}}{\overline{(x(t) - \bar{x})^2}} d\tau = \int_{0}^{\infty} B_{xx} d\tau
\end{align}

where $T$ is the integral time scale between two individual samples. We can then infer the precision uncertainty on the measurement to be
\begin{align}\label{eq:scanivalve_err}
    P = 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}
\end{align}
where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the time series acquired by 
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{x = 1}^{N}\frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N}}
\end{equation*}
and N is the number of independent samples within the time series $$N = \frac{1}{2T}$$

The autocorrelation error for each angle of attack is shown in table \ref{tab:auto_err}

\subsection{Non-Quantifiable Sources of Error}
\label{sec:non_quantifiable_sources_of_error}

\noindent
The experimental setup contained various areas of non-quantifiable sources of error such as the low frequency response in the pressure tubes, the precision error of the manometer, the turbulence in the airfoil wake, and the distortion effect in image acquisition.\newline

\noindent
For the pressure experienced in the wind tunnel to be measured by the scanivalve or manometer, the pressure changes had to travel down a series of long tubes before reaching the measuring devices. This long transit will cause a damping in the strength of pressure gradients and thus the extent or pressure changes at the manometer and scanivalve ends. This effect will result in a low frequency response of our measurements.\newline

\noindent
Two other sources of error arise from the unpredictable fluctuations in pressure information. Specifically, the imaging method of data acquisition from the manometer took a snapshot of the measurements in time. Not gaining a time series of the data prevents us from knowing the precision error of our measurements which would allow us to quantify the probability of getting the measurements we received from the distribution from all possible fluctuations. Another aspect of pressure fluctuations was seen in the airfoil's wake whose turbulent flow created random undulations in the measured pressure. The snapshot of this unsteady flow as measured by the rake device failed to capture the time series of these fluctuations, again, preventing the quantification of such oscillations in the airfoil wake velocity.\newline

\noindent
The last source of a non-quantifiable source of error is the the effect of image distortion on data annotation. In the data annotation workflow, we would mark upon the manometer images reference points and the length scale in between the reference points. The program then linearly interpolated this scale to measure the coordinates of points placed on the image. Although, angular distortions in an image cause a non-linear length scale which skews the measurements gained from the program thus adding to the error of the experiment. This error could be reduced through more direct manometer images, providing an image correction, or determining by hand, each manometer tube height.

\section{Conclusion}
The pressure distribution and nondimensional coefficients of flow around a Clark Y airfoil were determined at 11 different angles of attack. Measurements were taken separately using a scanivalve pressure transducer system and an inclined manometer. Both sets of measurements agree well with simulations from XFOIL and literature \cite{lyon_broeren_giguere_gopalarathnam_selig_1997}, and suggest a stall angle of $\alpha \approx 13^\circ$.

\noindent
The $C_P$ distribution very clearly shows a large plateau region for $\alpha \ge 13^\circ$, indicating onset of stall.

\noindent
$C_L$ increases linearly with $\alpha$ up to around 13 degrees, at which point it rounds off and drops sharply at stall. This is supported by a sharp rise in $C_D$ at $\alpha \approx 13^\circ$.

\noindent
$C_M$ remains relatively constant throughout all measurements, with no clear trend. This is not consistent with expectations in theory, and warrants additional investigation.

\noindent
For future experiments, there are several improvements which can be made:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple measurements at each angle of attack could be used to provide a better estimate of precision error.
    \item Bias errors of instrumentation in the experiment could be determined from references or by other experiments to better estimate the bias error of the pressure transducer, data acquisition card, and other components excluded.
    \item Perform better measurements of the manometer data, using a tripod-mounted camera to eliminate parallax error.
    \item Take time-average measurements of the pressure distribution for higher angles of attack to better capture the time-varying behaviour.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Overall, this experiment was successful in characterizing a Clark Y airfoil up to and around stall.

\section{Uncertainty Propagation}

\subsection{Scanivalve Calibration}

\begin{align*}
    \Delta P &= kV + m \\
    \delta \Delta P &= k\delta V\\
\end{align*}

The precision error of $\delta V$ on Scanivalve is given by autocorrelation analysis on port 36 for all 11 AOAs 

\subsection{Manometer Pressure}

Reference height $h_R = 18.2 \ \si{cm}$ (assumed errorless) on manometer used for baseline. $\theta = 61 \pm 0.1^\circ$

\begin{align*}
    P_{mano} &= -\rho g (h - h_R) \sin\theta\\
    \delta P_{mano} &= \sqrt{\left(-\rho g \sin \theta \delta h\right)^2 + \left(-\rho g  (h-h_R)\cos\theta \delta \theta\right)^2}\\
    \delta P_{mano} &= \sqrt{\left(-\rho g \sin \theta \delta h\right)^2 + \left(\frac{P_{mano}}{\tan \theta}\right)^2}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Flow Velocity}

For cases where we want the velocity of airfoil at a single pitot tube.

\begin{align*}
    U_\infty &=  \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta P}{\rho}} \\
    \delta U_\infty &= \frac{1}{2}\frac{U_\infty}{\Delta P} \delta \Delta P
\end{align*}

\subsection{Free Stream Velocity}

An average free stream velocity was obtained using ports 20 and 36. Assume zero error in $\rho$.

\begin{align*}
    U_\infty &= \frac{1}{2} \left(\sqrt{\frac{2 P_{20}}{\rho}} + \sqrt{\frac{2 P_{36}}{\rho}} \right) \\
    \delta U_\infty &= \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2U_\infty \rho} \delta P_{20}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2U_\infty \rho } \delta P_{36}\right)^2}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Velocity Deficit}

This is used to create the wake velocity distribution.

\begin{align*}
    \Delta V &= U_\infty - u\\
    \delta \Delta V &= \sqrt{\delta U_\infty^2 + \delta u^2}
\end{align*}
