# October 26 Notes
# 1. File Structure
* In the `Data` folder, we will have not only raw data, but also processed data
* All of the MATLAB code should assume that the data is in there, and work from that

# 2. Processing chain
## 1A: Pictures
* Raw Photos
* CSV data
* $c_p$ distribution on airfoil/$v-u$ distribution in wake, calibrated
## 1B: Scanivalve
* Raw voltage data
* $c_p$ distribution on airfoil/$v-u$ distribution in wake, calibrated

## 2: Refined Data
* Integration of $c_p$ distribution over the airfoil to get lift and moment
* Plots of $c_L, c_M$ with varying $\alpha$
* $c_D$ from wake calculations
